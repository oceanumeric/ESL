    "By retaining a subset of the predictors and discarding the rest, subset selection produces a model that is interpretable and has possibly lower prediction error than the full model. However, because it is a discrete process— variables are either retained or discarded—it often exhibits high variance, and so doesn’t reduce the prediction error of the full model. Shrinkage methods are more continuous, and don’t suffer as much from high variability."
